            pseudo code
            1. create a new class
            2. write the main code
            3. create a scanner code to get a number from user
            4. create a sout to ask the number from user
            5. create an int to store the number of user
            6. create the for loop line and put a condition in it as like number <=10
            7. after condition create your break in the for loop parentheses
            8. create another sout in the for loop body to print the result
            9. and run the code and make sure if it works or not
