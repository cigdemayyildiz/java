    // Possible Interview Question
    // What is difference between Array and ArrayList
    // Array has fixed size and ArrayList is dynamic
    // Array can store object and primitives, ArrayList only objects
    // Array has only length final variable, ArrayList has methods and size(); method
    // Array can be multidimensional, ArrayList cannot be multidimensional
    // They have different syntax
