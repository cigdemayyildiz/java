    // Possible Interview Questions
    // What is the difference between final, finally and finalize?
    // final is a keyword to make your variables, classes and methods final
    // finalize(); is a method to see system garbage collector is working or not
    // finally is a block that comes after try-catch to shows the final execution format
    // How do you handle the exceptions?
    // throws come after the method signature and try-catch-finally is inside of the block
    // What is the difference between error and exception?
    // You cannot handle the error (error comes from system)
    // You can handle exceptions (exception comes from application)
