    // Possible Interview Questions
    // What is the difference between Abstract and Interface?
    // *Abstract class is declared with 'abstract' keyword
    // *Abstract can have abstract and non-abstract methods in it
    // *We use extends keyword to call this abstract from another class
    // *We cannot create an object from abstract class
    // *We can only extend one parent
    // **Interface is declared with 'interface' keyword
    // **We use implements keyword to call this interface from another class
    // **We cannot create an object from interface
    // **Interface can have abstract method and also DEFAULT methods, static
    // **We can implement as many as parents we want.(extend can also come before implement but only one time)
    // Bir interface ile abstract ayni anda baska bir sinifa eklenebilir ama abstract(extends)
    // interface den (implements) once gelmeli
